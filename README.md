# React App with Reactjs


## Quick Start


Run `npm install` in order to install dependencies. At this point you can run `npm run dev` to see the example app at http://localhost:3000 and local json server at http://localhost:5000


### N.B:

As per requirements, I implement json server to save data into a json file. For this, when someone go to list the api will call on each reaload and data will update. So if someone add a user from the form submit and goto list to check the data then it will be quite difficult to get last data because the data will save at in the last index.
